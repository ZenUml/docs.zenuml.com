# Getting Started

Start using the ZenUML confluence plugin in 5 minutes

A ZenUML diagram can be created within any Confluence page, provided you have permission to edit the page.

ZenUML can be inserted like any other macro, using the macro browser. Click the drop down menu in the toolbar with the plugin icon, then click on “ZenUML Sequence Diagram”. If “ZenUML Sequence Diagram” is not directly in this menu, click on “Other macros” or “View more” and then enter “zenuml” in the search field at the top right of the dialog.

## View

In view mode, you can search on the diagram by using standard browser searching functionality.
